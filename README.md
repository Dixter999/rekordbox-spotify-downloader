**The ultimate solution for DJs to download and organize music from YouTube with Spotify playlist integration, optimized for Pioneer Rekordbox.**

Transform your Spotify playlists into a fully organized DJ library with automatic KEY detection (Camelot notation), BPM analysis, and quality filtering - perfect for harmonic mixing!

---

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

As a DJ, I faced a critical limitation: **Rekordbox doesn't allow editing tracks from Spotify streaming**. You can't analyze cue points, loops, or hot cues on Spotify tracks - you need local files.

The problem? Manually downloading hundreds of songs from Spotify playlists was tedious and time-consuming.

**The Solution:** I discovered two amazing open-source projects:
- **[spotify-backup](https://github.com/caseychu/spotify-backup)** by [@caseychu](https://github.com/caseychu) - Extract Spotify playlists to JSON
- **[ytm-dlapi](https://github.com/Thanatoslayer6/ytm-dlapi)** - YouTube Music download concept

I combined and enhanced these tools with:
- ✨ **Automatic KEY detection** using Essentia (Camelot notation for harmonic mixing)
- 🥁 **BPM analysis** for perfect beatmatching
- 🎯 **Quality filtering** (removes LIVE versions, UNRELEASED tracks, short clips)
- 📚 **Smart organization** (by genre, artist, or custom folders)
- 🔄 **Batch processing** for hundreds of songs at once

Now you can build a complete Rekordbox library from your Spotify playlists with full editing capabilities!

## 📖 How to Download Music (Step-by-Step)

### 🎯 Option 1: From Spotify Playlist (Recommended)

This is the easiest method - export your Spotify playlist and download all songs!

---

#### **Step 1: Export Your Spotify Playlist**

1. Open **[Exportify.net](https://exportify.net/)** in your browser
2. Click **"Get Started"** and log in with your Spotify account
3. Find your playlist and click the green **"Export"** button
4. A CSV file will download (e.g., `My_Playlist.csv`)

```
📁 Downloads/
   └── My_Playlist.csv   ← Downloaded from Exportify
```

---

#### **Step 2: Convert CSV to Song List**

Move the CSV file to your project folder and convert it:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Convert the CSV to a text file
python3 convert_csv_to_txt.py My_Playlist.csv
```

**Output:**
```
✓ Converted 85 songs from My_Playlist.csv
✓ Created: My_Playlist.txt
```

The text file looks like this:
```
# Converted from My_Playlist.csv
# Total songs: 85

Martin Garrix - Animals
Lost Frequencies - Are You With Me
Avicii - Levels
David Guetta - Titanium
...
```

---

#### **Step 3: Download All Songs**

Now download all songs to a folder (e.g., `HOUSE`):

```bash
python3 youtube_to_rekordbox_enhanced.py My_Playlist.txt --output rekordbox_music/HOUSE --prefer-lyrics
```

**Example Output:**
```

## 🎹 Camelot Key Notation

The system uses **Camelot Wheel notation** for harmonic mixing:

| Musical Key | Camelot | Musical Key | Camelot |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| C major     | 8B      | A minor     | 8A      |
| G major     | 9B      | E minor     | 9A      |
| D major     | 10B     | B minor     | 10A     |
| A major     | 11B     | F# minor    | 11A     |
| E major     | 12B     | C# minor    | 12A     |
| B major     | 1B      | G# minor    | 1A      |
| F# major    | 2B      | D# minor    | 2A      |
| Db major    | 3B      | Bb minor    | 3A      |
| Ab major    | 4B      | F minor     | 4A      |
| Eb major    | 5B      | C minor     | 5A      |
| Bb major    | 6B      | G minor     | 6A      |
| F major     | 7B      | D minor     | 7A      |

**Harmonic Mixing Rules:**
- Mix tracks with the **same number** (e.g., 8A → 8B)
- Mix tracks **±1** on the wheel (e.g., 8A → 9A or 7A)
